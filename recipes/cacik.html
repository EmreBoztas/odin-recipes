          <strong>Prepare the Cucumbers:</strong>
          Wash the cucumbers thoroughly and peel the skins. You can then either
          grate them or dice them into very small cubes, according to your
          preference.
        </p>

          <strong>Prepare the Yogurt Base:</strong> In a medium-sized bowl,
          whisk together the full-fat yogurt and cold water until you achieve a
          smooth, homogeneous consistency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Combine:</strong> Crush or finely grate the garlic cloves and
          add them to the yogurt mixture. Stir in the prepared cucumbers and
          season with salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Transfer the cacık to a serving
          bowl. Garnish the top with a sprinkle of dried mint, finely chopped
          fresh dill, and a drizzle of high-quality olive oil.

          <strong>Serving Suggestion:</strong> For an extra refreshing
          experience, you can add a few ice cubes to the bowl just before
          serving. Enjoy it as a cooling side dish with grilled meats, rice
          pilafs, or as a standalone snack.
