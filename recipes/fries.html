      <strong>Short Description:</strong> Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the
      inside, homemade French fries are a classic comfort food. This recipe
      covers the essential steps to achieve perfect fries using the double-fry
      method for maximum crispiness.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb (≈454 g) russet potatoes (about 2–3 medium potatoes)</li>
      <li>
        Oil for deep frying (neutral, high-smoke-point oil such as canola,
        vegetable, or peanut) — about 4 cups (≈950 ml) or enough to fill your
        fryer/pot for deep frying
      </li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>
        Optional: black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or fresh herbs for
        finishing
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Large pot or deep fryer</li>
      <li>Slotted spoon or spider/skimmer</li>
      <li>Paper towels or a cooling rack</li>
      <li>Large bowl and clean kitchen towel or paper towels for drying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Prep the potatoes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Peel (optional) and cut potatoes into even sticks — about 1/3–1/2
            inch (8–12 mm) thick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and soak for
            20–30 minutes (or up to 2 hours). This removes excess starch and
            helps them crisp.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dry the potatoes</h3>
        <p>
          Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water. Spread them out on a
          clean kitchen towel or paper towels and pat dry thoroughly. Removing
          moisture is key to crispiness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>First fry (blanching)</h3>
        <p>
          Heat oil to 325°F (≈163°C). Fry the potatoes in batches (do not
          overcrowd) until they are soft but not browned — about 4–6 minutes per
          batch. Remove and drain on paper towels or a rack. Let them cool for
          10–15 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Second fry (crisping)</h3>
        <p>
          Increase oil temperature to 375°F (≈191°C) (you can go up to 400°F /
          ≈204°C for extra crisp). Fry the cooled potatoes again in batches
          until golden brown and crisp — about 2–4 minutes. Remove, drain, and
          immediately season with salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Serve</h3>
        <p>
          Serve hot. Add any finishing seasonings (pepper, paprika, garlic
          powder, grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, etc.) right after frying so
          they stick.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips & Variations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cut Size Matters:</strong> Thicker fries (steak fries) take
        longer; shoestrings crisp faster. Keep pieces uniform for even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Longer For Extra Crispiness:</strong> A 1–2 hour soak (or
        overnight in the fridge) improves texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baked Alternative:</strong> Toss potato sticks with a little
        oil, spread on a tray, and bake at 425°F (≈218°C), turning once, until
        golden (approx. 25–35 minutes). They’ll be less deep-fried crispy but
        still tasty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasoning Ideas:</strong> Truffle oil & parmesan, Cajun spice,
        garlic & rosemary, or classic vinegar & salt (British style).
      </li>
    </ul>
