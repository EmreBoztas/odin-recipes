    <h2>Steps (step-by-step)</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Prepare the leaves</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If using jarred grape leaves: rinse well under cold water to remove
            brine and drain. Pat dry.
          </li>
          <li>
            If using fresh: blanch leaves in boiling water 1–2 minutes until
            soft, then transfer to ice water and drain.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
        <h3><li>The filling</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            4 tbsp olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the chopped
            onion until soft and translucent (4–6 min).
          </li>
          <li>Add pine nuts and sauté 1–2 minutes until slightly toasted.</li>
          <li>Stir in tomato paste and cook 1 minute.</li>
          <li>
            Add the rinsed rice, salt, pepper, and allspice; toss to coat the
            rice with the oil and paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) water (or a little less) — just enough to
            start softening the rice — bring to a simmer, cover, and cook gently
            for 8–10 minutes until the rice is partly absorbed but still firmer
            than fully cooked (it will finish cooking inside the leaves).
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from heat; stir in chopped parsley, mint, currants (if
            using), and lemon juice. Let the filling cool until easy to handle.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
        <h3><li>Roll the leaves</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lay a grape leaf glossy side down, stem end facing you. Trim the
            stem if long.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place ~1–1½ tsp (for small rolls) to 1 tbsp (for larger rolls) of
            filling near the stem, centered horizontally but a bit below center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fold the bottom edge up over the filling, fold both sides toward the
            center, then roll tightly away from you to form a cigar-shaped
            parcel. Keep them snug but don’t overpack — rice expands. Place
            seam-side down. Repeat until filling is used.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      
        <h3><li>Assemble in the pot</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Spread a few torn or whole grape leaves on the bottom of the pot
            (this prevents sticking) and add a few lemon slices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pack the rolls seam-side down in tight concentric circles or rows.
            Place them snugly — this helps them keep shape while cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drizzle 2–3 tbsp olive oil and the juice of 1 lemon over the rolls.
            Add enough water or stock to cover the rolls by about 1 cm (½ inch).
            If needed, place a small heatproof plate on top of the rolls to keep
            them submerged.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
        <h3><li>Cook</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, then reduce to low,
            cover, and cook for 30–45 minutes (vegetarian) or 45–60 minutes
            (meat variation), until rice and meat (if used) are fully cooked.
            Check liquid level midway; add a little hot water if it looks dry.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
        <h3><li>Rest & serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Turn off heat and let the pot sit, covered, for 10–15 minutes. This
            firms the rolls and settles flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve warm or at room temperature with plain yogurt, lemon wedges,
            and extra olive oil.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
